# rgb2hsv_approximate - recover _approximate_ HSV values from RGB.
# 
#   NOTE 1: This function is a long-term work in process; expect
#   results to change slightly over time as this function is
#   refined and improved.
# 
#   NOTE 2: This function is most accurate when the input is an
#   RGB color that came from a fully-saturated HSV color to start
#   with.  E.g. CHSV( hue, 255, 255) -> CRGB -> CHSV will give
#   best results.
# 
#   NOTE 3: This function is not nearly as fast as HSV-to-RGB.
#   It is provided for those situations when the need for this
#   function cannot be avoided, or when extremely high performance
#   is not needed.
# 
#   NOTE 4: Why is this 'only' an "approximation"?
#   Not all RGB colors have HSV equivalents!  For example, there
#   is no HSV value that will ever convert to RGB(255,255,0) using
#   the code provided in this library.   So if you try to
#   convert RGB(255,255,0) 'back' to HSV, you'll necessarily get
#   only an approximation.  Emphasis has been placed on getting
#   the 'hue' as close as usefully possible, but even that's a bit
#   of a challenge.  The 8-bit HSV and 8-bit RGB color spaces
#   are not a "bijection".
# 
#   Nevertheless, this function does a pretty good job, particularly
#   at recovering the 'hue' from fully saturated RGB colors that
#   originally came from HSV rainbow colors.  So if you start
#   with CHSV(hue_in,255,255), and convert that to RGB, and then
#   convert it back to HSV using this function, the resulting output
#   hue will either exactly the same, or very close (+/-1).
#   The more desaturated the original RGB color is, the rougher the
#   approximation, and the less accurate the results.

# Functions to convert HSV colors to RGB colors.
# 
#  The basically fall into two groups: spectra, and rainbows.
#  Spectra and rainbows are not the same thing.  Wikipedia has a good
#  illustration here
#   http:# upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/f/f6/Prism_compare_rainbow_01.png
#  from this article
#   http:# en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rainbow#Number_of_colours_in_spectrum_or_rainbow
#  that shows a 'spectrum' and a 'rainbow' side by side.  Among other
#  differences, you'll see that a 'rainbow' has much more yellow than
#  a plain spectrum.  "Classic" LED color washes are spectrum based, and
#  usually show very little yellow.
# 
#  Wikipedia's page on HSV color space, with pseudocode for conversion
#  to RGB color space
#   http:# en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HSL_and_HSV
#  Note that their conversion algorithm, which is (naturally) very popular
#  is in the "maximum brightness at any given hue" style, vs the "uniform
#  brightness for all hues" style.
# 
#  You can't have both; either purple is the same brightness as red, e.g
#    red = #FF0000 and purple = #800080 -> same "total light" output
#  OR purple is 'as bright as it can be', e.g.
#    red = #FF0000 and purple = #FF00FF -> purple is much brighter than red.
#  The colorspace conversions here try to keep the apparent brightness
#  constant even as the hue varies.
# 
#  Adafruit's "Wheel" function, discussed here
#   http:# forums.adafruit.com/viewtopic.php?f=47&t=22483
#  is also of the "constant apparent brightness" variety.
# 
#  TODO: provide the 'maximum brightness no matter what' variation.

    # We now scale rampup and rampdown to a 0-255 range -- at least
    # in theory, but here's where architecture-specific decsions
    # come in to play:
    # To scale them up to 0-255, we'd want to multiply by 4.
    # But in the very next step, we multiply the ramps by other
    # values and then divide the resulting product by 256.
    # So which is faster?
    #   ((ramp * 4) * othervalue) / 256
    # or
    #   ((ramp    ) * othervalue) /  64
    # It depends on your processor architecture.
    # On 8-bit AVR, the "/ 256" is just a one-cycle register move,
    # but the "/ 64" might be a multicycle shift process. So on AVR
    # it's faster do multiply the ramp values by four, and then
    # divide by 256.
    # On ARM, the "/ 256" and "/ 64" are one cycle each, so it's
    # faster to NOT multiply the ramp values by four, and just to
    # divide the resulting product by 64 (instead of 256).
    # Moral of the story: trust your profiler, not your insticts.

    # Since there's an AVR assembly version elsewhere, we'll
    # assume what we're on an architecture where any number of
    # bit shifts has roughly the same cost, and we'll remove the
    # redundant math at the source level:

    #  # scale up to 255 range
